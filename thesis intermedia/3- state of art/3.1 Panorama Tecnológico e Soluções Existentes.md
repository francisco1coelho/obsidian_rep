#### Introduction

The **Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS)** market continues to evolve rapidly in 2025, fueled by advancements in **real-time operational analytics**, **generative AI (GenAI)**, and **democratized access to insights**. **Natural Language to Dashboard (NL→Dash)** functionalities are gaining traction, enabling users to query and modify dashboards via natural language. However, full **one-shot dashboard generation**—automatically creating title, layout, metrics, filters, and thresholds from a single prompt—remains limited in CCaaS platforms. While GenAI has enabled partial NL interactions (e.g., querying metrics or editing elements), complete automation is nascent, with broader BI tools like ThoughtSpot leading in non-CCaaS contexts.

#### Individual Critical Analysis

**NICE (CXone / Enlighten)**  
NICE leads with advanced NL→Dash capabilities via **Enlighten Actions**, **CXone Dashboards**, and the **Observability Copilot** (introduced in 25.3 release, August 2025). Users can query dashboard data in natural language (e.g., "Top 10 supervisors with most sessions?") and modify elements like categories/intents via Copilot commands (e.g., add/remove/rename in 25.4 release, October 2025). AI filtering with NL prompts supports multi-ACD and languages. However, **no evidence of full one-shot generation** exists—structural elements (e.g., layout, thresholds) often require manual tweaks, and it's more Q&A/ad-hoc than end-to-end automation. Criticism: Dependence on iterative prompts can frustrate users in real scenarios, and integration with real streams is inconsistent.

**Genesys (Cloud CX)**  
Genesys offers robust analytics via **Reports, Views, and Dashboards**, with 2025 updates focusing on AI Agents for NL access to metrics, trends, and agent activity (September 2025). Virtual Agent dashboards (July 2025) provide performance views, but configuration is manual/UI-based. No documented NL→Dash for generating layouts or full dashboards; LLM integration is limited to conversational agents, not semantic modeling. Criticism: Lack of NL for initial creation makes it obsolete compared to NICE, prioritizing interactions over structured analytics.

**Talkdesk (Explore / Live Dashboards)**  
**Talkdesk Explore** and **Live Dashboards** emphasize real-time monitoring, with investments in conversational AI (e.g., Autopilot for multi-lingual NLP, 59+ languages in 2025). However, dashboard creation remains manual via a visual editor, with no evidence of NL→Dash or semantic pipelines to convert prompts into configurations. 2025 updates focus on conversational flows, not dashboard generation. Criticism: The focus on customer-facing AI ignores gaps in back-end analytics, leaving supervisors dependent on manual setups.

**Five9 (Analytics / AI Insights)**  
Five9 advances with **AI Insights** and **Spotlight** (launched March 2025), using GenAI for custom metrics and NL queries ("Ask Your Data Anything" for instant insights via RAG). Agentic CX enables contextual responses, but dashboard creation is manual (selecting campaigns/skills via UI). No support for one-shot generation. Criticism: While GenAI improves insights, the lack of full automation exposes risks like inconsistency in real data, and PoCs can fail (30% in 2025).

#### Technical Comparison

The comparative matrix reveals limited maturity in NL→Dash in CCaaS, with NICE leading in NL modifications. No vendor supports complete one-shot generation, including all structural elements. For context, generic BI tools like ThoughtSpot offer NL queries for ad-hoc visualizations, but lack CCaaS-specific integration.

| Vendor   | NL→Dash Support | Scope of Generation                  | NL Modifications | GenAI Integration | Public Evidence (2025 Updates)          |
|----------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| NICE    | Advanced       | Q&A, charts, filtering; partial mods | Yes (add/remove) | Yes (Copilot)    | 25.3/25.4 Releases; Observability Copilot |
| Genesys | Partial        | Manual dashboards; NL metrics access | No             | Yes (AI Agents)  | Sept 2025 AI Agents; Virtual Dashboards |
| Talkdesk| No            | Manual dashboards                    | No             | Partial (NLP)    | Autopilot Updates; No NL-Dash Evidence  |
| Five9   | Partial        | Manual creation; NL insights/queries | No             | Yes (Spotlight)  | March 2025 Spotlight; Genius AI         |

Comparative evidence indicates that, despite advances in GenAI (e.g., NLP for emotions), NL→Dash in CCaaS is immature, focusing on queries without semantic completeness.

#### Gap Identification

The analysis reveals **persistent gaps**: No vendor interprets a single prompt to generate fully configured dashboards. There is a lack of integration with **semantic metric layers** for consistency and **real-time streams** for dynamic updates. Additional criticism: GenAI risks (e.g., hallucinations, PoC abandonment) are not addressed, limiting adaptability. Outside CCaaS, multi-agent LLM frameworks (May 2025) outperform baselines by +31% for iterative generation.

#### Concluding Synthesis

This analysis exposes a **persistent technological gap** in the CCaaS ecosystem for NL-based dashboard generation. Platforms fragment between Q&A and manual configuration, without a solution for complete one-shot prompts. The **proposed internship project** contributes innovatively with LLMs for end-to-end generation, addressing gaps in automation, semantics, and real-time. Criticism: For relevance in 2025, integrate failure risks and external benchmarks to avoid obsolescence.
