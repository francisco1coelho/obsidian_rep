#### Introduction

The **Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS)** market continues to evolve rapidly in 2025, fueled by advancements in **real-time operational analytics**, **generative AI (GenAI)**, and **democratized access to insights**. **Natural Language to Dashboard (NL→Dash)** functionalities are gaining traction, enabling users to query and modify dashboards via natural language. However, full **one-shot dashboard generation**—automatically creating title, layout, metrics, filters, and thresholds from a single prompt—remains limited in CCaaS platforms. While GenAI has enabled partial NL interactions (e.g., querying metrics or editing elements), complete automation is nascent, with broader BI tools like ThoughtSpot leading in non-CCaaS contexts.

#### Individual Critical Analysis

**NICE (CXone / Enlighten)**  
NICE leads with advanced NL→Dash capabilities via **Enlighten Actions**, **CXone Dashboards**, and the **Observability Copilot** (introduced in 25.3 release, August 2025). Users can query dashboard data in natural language (e.g., "Top 10 supervisors with most sessions?") and modify elements like categories/intents via Copilot commands (e.g., add/remove/rename in 25.4 release, October 2025). AI filtering with NL prompts supports multi-ACD and languages. However, **no evidence of full one-shot generation** exists—structural elements (e.g., layout, thresholds) often require manual tweaks, and it's more Q&A/ad-hoc than end-to-end automation. Criticism: Dependence on iterative prompts can frustrate users in real scenarios, and integration with real streams is inconsistent.

**Genesys (Cloud CX)**  
Genesys offers robust analytics via **Reports, Views, and Dashboards**, with 2025 updates focusing on AI Agents for NL access to metrics, trends, and agent activity (September 2025). Virtual Agent dashboards (July 2025) provide performance views, but configuration is manual/UI-based. No documented NL→Dash for generating layouts or full dashboards; LLM integration is limited to conversational agents, not semantic modeling. Criticism: Lack of NL for initial creation makes it obsolete compared to NICE, prioritizing interactions over structured analytics.

**Talkdesk (Explore / Live Dashboards)**  
**Talkdesk Explore** and **Live Dashboards** emphasize real-time monitoring, with investments in conversational AI (e.g., Autopilot for multi-lingual NLP, 59+ languages in 2025). However, dashboard creation remains manual via a visual editor, with no evidence of NL→Dash or semantic pipelines to convert prompts into configurations. 2025 updates focus on conversational flows, not dashboard generation. Criticism: The focus on customer-facing AI ignores gaps in back-end analytics, leaving supervisors dependent on manual setups.

**Five9 (Analytics / AI Insights)**  
Five9 advances with **AI Insights** and **Spotlight** (launched March 2025), using GenAI for custom metrics and NL queries ("Ask Your Data Anything" for instant insights via RAG). Agentic CX enables contextual responses, but dashboard creation is manual (selecting campaigns/skills via UI). No support for one-shot generation. Criticism: While GenAI improves insights, the lack of full automation exposes risks like inconsistency in real data, and PoCs can fail (30% in 2025).

#### Technical Comparison

The comparative matrix reveals limited maturity in NL→Dash in CCaaS, with NICE leading in NL modifications. No vendor supports complete one-shot generation, including all structural elements. For context, generic BI tools like ThoughtSpot offer NL queries for ad-hoc visualizations, but lack CCaaS-specific integration.

| Vendor   | NL→Dash Support | Scope of Generation                  | NL Modifications | GenAI Integration | Public Evidence (2025 Updates)          |
|----------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| NICE    | Advanced       | Q&A, charts, filtering; partial mods | Yes (add/remove) | Yes (Copilot)    | 25.3/25.4 Releases; Observability Copilot |
| Genesys | Partial        | Manual dashboards; NL metrics access | No             | Yes (AI Agents)  | Sept 2025 AI Agents; Virtual Dashboards |
| Talkdesk| No            | Manual dashboards                    | No             | Partial (NLP)    | Autopilot Updates; No NL-Dash Evidence  |
| Five9   | Partial        | Manual creation; NL insights/queries | No             | Yes (Spotlight)  | March 2025 Spotlight; Genius AI         |

Comparative evidence indicates that, despite advances in GenAI (e.g., NLP for emotions), NL→Dash in CCaaS is immature, focusing on queries without semantic completeness.

#### Gap Identification

The analysis reveals **persistent gaps**: No vendor interprets a single prompt to generate fully configured dashboards. There is a lack of integration with **semantic metric layers** for consistency and **real-time streams** for dynamic updates. Additional criticism: GenAI risks (e.g., hallucinations, PoC abandonment) are not addressed, limiting adaptability. Outside CCaaS, multi-agent LLM frameworks (May 2025) outperform baselines by +31% for iterative generation.

#### Concluding Synthesis

This analysis exposes a **persistent technological gap** in the CCaaS ecosystem for NL-based dashboard generation. Platforms fragment between Q&A and manual configuration, without a solution for complete one-shot prompts. The **proposed internship project** contributes innovatively with LLMs for end-to-end generation, addressing gaps in automation, semantics, and real-time. Criticism: For relevance in 2025, integrate failure risks and external benchmarks to avoid obsolescence.

### Individual Critical Analysis

### NICE (CXone / Enlighten AI)

The **NICE** platform, through its **CXone** and **Enlighten AI** solutions, is positioned as one of the most advanced systems in the field of **customer experience (CX) analytics** and **AI-assisted operational intelligence**. The key differentiator of its offering lies in the integration of **natural language query mechanisms** applied directly to operational data. This functionality allows users to **ask questions in natural language and automatically generate analytical reports and dashboards** without requiring complex configuration processes or specialized technical expertise [1]. Such an approach democratizes access to information, reduces the time required for performance analysis, and accelerates decision-making in contact center environments [2].

Despite these advanced capabilities, **there is no evidence that the platform supports the full and automated creation of complete dashboards** — that is, the generation of **layouts, key performance indicators (KPIs), interactive filters, and configured visualizations** from a single natural language prompt. Dashboard construction remains **dependent on manual configuration and the use of predefined widgets**, indicating that full automation of the visual experience is not yet supported [1][3].

In summary, NICE stands out as a **leader in the integration of conversational AI for operational data exploration and real-time analytics**, yet **there are no public records confirming full automation of dashboard creation** or the ability to generate complete dashboards from a single prompt.

### Gap Identification

All platforms support some level of **natural language interaction**, allowing **automated queries and the generation of individual reports or charts**.  
However, **none implement full multi-widget dashboard creation** — including **layout, filters, KPIs, and update logic** — in an automated way.  
Dashboard construction still requires **manual intervention**, through **visual editors, widgets, or templates**, which limits both the **scalability of analytics** and the **autonomy of non-technical users**.

### Conclusion

In summary, the four analyzed platforms — **NICE CXone**, **Genesys Cloud CX**, **Talkdesk**, and **Five9** — demonstrate **different levels of AI integration** within their analytical capabilities.  
**NICE** and **Genesys** stand out for offering **natural language query** features that enable the generation of **automatic reports and charts**, although they still lack full dashboard creation capabilities.  
**Five9** follows a similar approach by introducing **natural language interaction** for **custom metrics**, while **Talkdesk** remains more focused on **conversational AI and service automation**, with **fully manual dashboards**.  
Overall, all solutions remain **dependent on manual configuration** to build complete dashboards, showing that **full automation of dashboard generation through AI** is still **not a feature available** in the CCaaS market as of 2025.
