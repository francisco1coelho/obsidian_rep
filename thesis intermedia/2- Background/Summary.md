No fim do capítulo, faz uma breve conclusão a resumir a importância de cada bloco — por exemplo:

> “Compreender as bases da análise em tempo real e o papel dos LLMs na tradução de linguagem natural em configurações estruturadas é essencial para contextualizar o desenvolvimento da solução proposta nesta dissertação.”


This chapter established the technological and conceptual foundations underlying this dissertation.  
It began by examining the architecture of **real-time analytics systems** (Section 2.1), highlighting how modern data pipelines enable continuous data ingestion, low-latency processing, and live visualization of operational metrics. The discussion then focused on the **contact center domain** (Section 2.2), detailing key performance indicators, semantic data models, and the role of ontologies in ensuring metric consistency across analytical layers.

The chapter proceeded to explore the emergence of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** as engines for **structured output generation** (Section 2.3), describing how recent frameworks enable language models to produce valid, machine-readable configurations. This capability directly supports the transformation of natural language into dashboard specifications — a process conceptually rooted in the **Natural Language to Visualization (NL→VIS)** and **Natural Language to SQL (NL→SQL)** paradigms (Section 2.4). Together, these techniques demonstrate how linguistic intent can be mapped to structured analytical representations.

Finally, the concept of **Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS)** (Section 2.6) was introduced as the industrial and technological context for this work. CCaaS platforms integrate cloud infrastructure, data streaming, and open APIs, providing an ideal environment for embedding AI-driven analytics and conversational interfaces. Within this ecosystem, the proposed system builds upon these foundations to introduce a semantic, LLM-enhanced layer that bridges human language and real-time contact center metrics.

The following chapter builds on this foundation by reviewing the **state of the art** in natural language interfaces, dashboard automation, and AI-assisted analytics, situating the proposed solution within existing research and industry developments.
