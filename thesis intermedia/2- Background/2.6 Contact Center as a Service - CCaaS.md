The evolution of contact centers from on-premise infrastructure to **cloud-native, API-driven platforms** has given rise to the model known as **Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS)**. In this paradigm, contact center operations — including telephony, routing, analytics, and workforce management — are delivered as scalable cloud services rather than as locally hosted systems (Gartner, 2024).

A defining characteristic of CCaaS platforms is their support for **real-time event streaming**. Every call, chat, or message generates a continuous flow of structured events — agent status changes, queue updates, or customer interactions — that can be captured, processed, and visualized in near real time. For example, **Amazon Connect Streams API** and **Twilio Flex Insights** expose WebSocket and REST endpoints through which live metrics (e.g., number of active calls, service level, or average handle time) can be consumed by third-party applications (AWS, 2023; Twilio, 2024). This streaming-first design enables organizations to build **custom analytics pipelines and dashboards** that reflect operational conditions with minimal latency.

A key advantage of CCaaS platforms is their **open and modular design**, which makes them ideal environments for embedding AI capabilities. Supervisors and quality teams can access real-time metrics through REST or WebSocket APIs, while developers can extend the platform with **conversational interfaces, predictive analytics, or AI copilots**. This flexibility aligns directly with the purpose of this dissertation: leveraging **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to enable **natural language–driven dashboard generation** in a CCaaS context.

In summary, CCaaS represents the convergence of **cloud infrastructure, data streaming, and AI integration**, offering an ideal environment for innovation in real-time analytics. Within this paradigm, the present work contributes by introducing a **semantic, AI-enhanced layer** that bridges human language and contact center performance metrics, demonstrating how LLMs can augment both the usability and the intelligence of CCaaS analytics systems.
